# 📊  Fundraising Predictive Modeling 💹

## 📌 Project Overview

The dataset consists of information about past donors and non-donors, including their demographic, financial indicators, and amount of donations. The goal is to analyze the dataset to develop a model that can understand donor intent, engagement, and predict the expected contribution amount. By applying classification and regression techniques, we can help the organization reduce mailing costs while increasing total donation revenue.<br>

##  🗂️ Problem Statement

This project aims to develop predictive analytics models to support data-driven fundraising decisions. Specifically, the study focuses on predicting which individuals are most likely to donate in response to a mailing campaign and estimating expected donation amounts among potential donors. Using demographic, financial, and behavioral data, the project seeks to identify the key characteristics and features that significantly influence donor response and donation value.<br>

## 📝Data Description
This dataset has 6002 rows.

Target Variables
The dataset contains two target variables for different types of models:
Classification: Predicting donr (whether someone donates). <br>
Regression: Predicting damt (amount donated in $).

## 🛠️ Methodology
• Classification Models: To evaluate classification models with the target variable, Selection Statistics is set to Misclassification Rate for the Model Comparison node.

• Regression Models: To evaluate regression models with the target variable, Selection Statistics is set to ASE.

## 🚀 Key Findings
1️⃣ Built and evaluated classification and regression models for fundraising analysis, achieving ~90% classification accuracy and improving donor targeting decisions.<br>
2️⃣ Identified high-value donor segments through Python and Excel analysis, highlighting top contributors—particularly affluent female homeowners with 2–3 children and high wealth scores (8–9).<br>
3️⃣ Combined donation likelihood, expected gift amount, and mailing costs to evaluate campaign profitability, showing how targeted outreach could turn a potential loss into an estimated $3.4K net profit, while identifying areas for future improvement.<br>
